🧟‍♂️ Zombie Smash
One arena. Endless undead. Smash or be eaten.

The virus spread fast. Society fell faster. Now you’re trapped in tight, makeshift combat zones overrun with the infected. With only your reflexes, a handful of power-ups, and pure grit, you’ll fight wave after wave of zombies in a fast-paced survival arcade experience.

Zombie Smash delivers retro-style top-down gameplay with a modern twist: tight arenas, constant pressure, and satisfying zombie destruction — all backed by bold visuals and a high-energy soundtrack.
